# About 👩🏼‍💻

- This repository is based on **Reverse Shell Scripting**.
- The `server.py` contains the code that allows the users to host a server to which different clients can connect to it
  - From the host, we can initiate a terminal through which we can execute different commands in clients 
- The `client.py` contains the code that establishes the connection with the host

# How to run the code ? 🏃🏼‍♀️
- Clone the repository using this command `` git clone https://github.com/HOTSONHONET/pySHELL.git ``
- Open up terminal/Powershell and the `server.py` script, it will initiate the server using the following the code `` py server.py ``
- In your client computer, run the `client.py` using the following command `` py client.py ``
- This will establish the connection between the client and the server...
